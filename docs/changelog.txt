<h5>2.32 [2011/10/21] (JJD.fr)]</h5>
<hr>
 - Fixed the "getSearchEvent" used by the search for Xoops;
   It did not take into account only the first word of an expression.
   In addition it has been adapted for a search from the module itself
   with specific criteria (expression + category and then the month and year are expected).
   The research was done on the fields 'EVENT_TITLE', 'event_desc', 'event_contact', 'EVENT_ADDRESS'.
   The field 'cat_name' was added to allow the fields to search
   to find words in the title of the category.

 - Added a view of research.
   This allows for a wider search for a phrase, a category
   over the year, month, ...
   date has been changed to "DataTime" instead of int (11).

   Think in this tab to add those options visible in the modules.

   Remove the width of the class. "Tip-top"
   To enable automatic resizing.
   Adding attributes 'infoBulle_zone1', 'infoBulle_zone2' and 'infoBulle_zone3'
   pemettre to display images and text.
   'InfoBulle_zone1': positioning the first balloon image or text
   'InfoBulle_zone2': 2nd positions the tooltip right of the first if there is an image
   'InfoBulle_zone3': 2nd positions the tool tip in the first if there is an image
   To change the position of the second tooltip change 'infoBulle_zone2'
   by 'infoBulle_zone3' extcal_infobulle.html in the template.
