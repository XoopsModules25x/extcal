<h5>2.32 [2011/10/21] (JJD.fr)]</h5>
<hr>
 - Fixed the "getSearchEvent" used by the search for Xoops;
   It did not take into account only the first word of an expression.
   In addition it has been adapted for a search from the module itself
   with specific criteria (expression + category and then the month and year are expected).
   The research was done on the fields 'EVENT_TITLE', 'event_desc', 'event_contact', 'EVENT_ADDRESS'.
   The field 'cat_name' was added to allow the fields to search
   to find words in the title of the category.

 - Added a view of research.
   This allows for a wider search for a phrase, a category
   over the year, month, ...
   date has been changed to "DataTime" instead of int (11).

   Remove the width of the class. "Tip-top"
   To enable automatic resizing.

   pemettre to display images and text.
   'InfoBulle_zone1': positioning the first balloon image or text
   'InfoBulle_zone2': 2nd positions the tooltip right of the first if there is an image
   'InfoBulle_zone3': 2nd positions the tool tip in the first if there is an image
   To change the position of the second tooltip change 'infoBulle_zone2'
   by 'infoBulle_zone3' extcal_infobulle.html in the template.
